Hello there!

This set of files are made to calculate the bessel functions of first kind Jn(x)

most probably will have some bugs, to improve them send an email to ssromerogon@miners.utep.edu

To execute are needed the next steps:


1.- The file bessel.c contains the loop for the calculations with breaking criteria, and factorial.h, 
is the factorial  function to calculate the bessel functions. As well, the minimun value (epsilon) 
to do calculations, for this file has been set as 1e-38.


2.- Run the command  make in the current directory to build the "exe" called bessel_calc


3.- To run it, just type in command line : ./bessel_calc

4.- The program will request for the variables and whatever it needs.



Have a nice day! 

Like on Facebook  ;P , sorry, just kidding
