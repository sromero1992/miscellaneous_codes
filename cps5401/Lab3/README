This "package" computes the solution of Aa=B, getting B from the
assignment_3, doing a signal analysis of the form:

f(x) ~ fls(x) = a1 f1(x)+ a2 f2(x)+...+ak fk(x)

fk= ak1 sin((k1-1)) + ak2 cos(k2 x)

where a is the vector solution  for the matrix problem of finding such values to solve.

R(a) = R(a1,a2,...,ak) = sum {i to n} [ yi- fls(xi)) ] ^ 2
R(a)= at A a - 2 Bt a + Const
nabla( R(a))= 2Aa -2B

/////////////////////Requeriments///////////////////
To do such calculations you must have Lapack,open mp and mpi:
libllapack-dev
liblblas-dev
libomp-dev
libcr-dev
mpich

//////////////////Run////////////////
Go to the desired paralellization kind, e.g.
OpenMP/
and do  sh build , or make.

The program will display the vector solution for a.
