Coding language: FORTRAN   

## Description
   
Guess generator for FOD positions to be used in the Fermi-LÃ¶wdin orbital self-interaction correction (FLO-SIC) method.           
There is a manual, explaining the underlying idea of this program and showing some examples for its usage.

## Installation 
The fodMC is written in FORTRAN. Make sure you have a fortran compiler like gfortran to compile the code.  
To compile the code, go to the *src* directory and type   

        bash compile.sh


## Running the code 

Go to the folders *examples*. 

You might want to change the relative directory paths in the run.sh to your absolute src-directory (see manual as well).                                         

Then, type 

        bash run.sh

to run the code for a given input in the file *system*.

## Manual/Tutorial

There is a manual in the 'doc' folder, called fodMC.pdf. 
Furthermore, there are several tutorial videos about the 
usage and handling of the fodMC at youtube, 
at the channel 'The extended Physiker Clan'.
